# VBA Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
Using the VBA tools inside Microsoft Excel, I constructed an algorithm to analyze over 3,000 stock data points in a given year to determine their Total Daily Volume and Percentage Return. The purpose of this project was to refactor the VBA code to run faster by collecting the data more efficiently.
